Chrome Extension to Filter DOM Content by Keywords

Sometimes I still want to browse the internet and news sites, but I don't always want to be bombarded with the same repeated topics.

## Functionality

Installing the extension will allow users a curate of filtered keywords.
If any DOM element is found on a webpage containing one of the keywords, it will be removed from the DOM.
